## = SAMPLE PROPERTIES FILE FOR GALICASTER DASHBOARD =
## ===================================================
##
## This file includes all the available configuration options for Galicaster Dashboard.
## ALL the configurations have default values, which are the values shown in the lines commented. 
## You should uncomment ONLY the lines beginning with a single pound sign (#), which show the available configuration keys and
## their defaults. The lines starting with two pound signs (##) are pure comments or explanations and should not be modified.
## All The values are case-sensitive, EXCEPT FOR THE 'MODE' PARAMETER.
## Any other parameters, apart from the ones specified in this file, will be ignored. 

## 'mode' controls the Dashboard operation mode with regards to the screenshots. It may take two values:
##   - PUSH: The Dashboard assumes the agents will periodically send screenshots by themselves. Therefore, the Dashboard will
##           NOT take any action to extract those screenshots itself. We could also dub this the 'passive mode'.
##           Please note that, unlike the 'PULL' mode, this one does not require an active VNC server in the agents.
##   - PULL: The Dashboard will actively poll the list of available agents to obtain a screenshot. Please note that this 
##           requires for the agents to have an active VNC server that the Dashboard can connect to. This is an 'active mode',
##           in contrast with the 'PUSH' mode.
## Please note that this value is case-insensitive, so you may use any capitalization of the above values (push, PuLl, etc.)
## If an illegal value (other than the ones indicated above) is used, the Dashboard uses the default (push).
# mode = push

## This key specifies the maximum time (in MILLISECONDS) to wait for a ping response from an agent. Any delay longer than this
## value will result in the agent being considered as inactive or unreachable.
# ping.timeout = 5000

## ============================================================================================================================
## = The following values are only relevant to the 'PULL' mode, because they control the frequency and resources used to poll = 
## = the agents and the VNC passwords used to connect to them. They will be ignored when the Dashboard is in 'PULL' mode.     =
## ============================================================================================================================

## This key controls the time (in SECONDS) between two subsequent snapshots. The lower this value, the more frequently the 
## agent's screenshots are refreshed, but the system load will be also higher. 
# snapshot.period = 60

## This key controls the maximum time to wait (in SECONDS) for a snapshot to be taken from an agent. A higher value can be set 
## up if the network latency is also high, but the default is already loose enough.
# snapshot.timeout = 10

## This key controls the maximum number of threads extracting snapshots at the same time. A larger value will in theory deal 
## with more agents at the same time, but it will also lead to a higher load in the server.
# max.concurrent = 5

## This key specifies a default VNC password to connect to the agents, when there is not an agent-specific password defined (see
## below). If not present, this value defaults to an empty string, which is equivalent to an open (no password) VNC connection.
# default.vnc.password = 

## This file may contain any number of agent-specific VNC passwords. Those are specified using the following syntax:
##      agent.<name>.vnc.password = <password>
## , where <name> is the agent name and <password> its VNC password. If such a property cannot be found for a certain agent,
## then the value in 'default.vnc.password' (or its default) is used. Some examples follow:
# agent.my.agent.name.vnc.password = my.agent.name's password
# agent.example.vnc.password = example_password
# agent.galicaster-101.vnc.password = mypass
